**** Ultimate Converter Program (Student 1) ****

Brief: Create the 'Ultimate Conversion Program' which allows users to convert between units for distance, time and mass. 

The good:
The program works for expected values and correctly converts between desired units provided both units are in the same 'domain' (eg: it will convert between mm and cm as both are units of distance).

To be fixed:
- The program crashes if users don't enter a number for the amount to be converted.
- The program crashes if users attempt to convert between domains (eg: go from hours to cm).

In a perfect world...
The code would be a lot more efficient.  It would include comments that describe it's behaviour.

Please see the S_01_conversion_tester.py file for possible test plans (you should add additional cases to allow the function to be tested).
