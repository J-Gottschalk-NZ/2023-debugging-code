**** Finding Factors Program (Student 4) ****

Brief: Create a program that allows users to enter an integer (more than 0).  The program should display the factors for the number in question.  The completed program should be efficient and should tell the user if the number they have chosen is a prime number / perfect square.  The final list of factors should not contain any duplicates.

This is a partial student solution to the problem and is a work in progress.  Right now, when the program is run we get an error.  There are actually two issues with this program and once they fixed, the program will work (although it is an inefficient solution to the problem).
