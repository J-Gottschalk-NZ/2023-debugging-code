**** Area / Perimeter Program (Student 5) ****

Brief: Create a program that allows users to calculate the area / perimeter of a rectangle (where the width / length must be numbers that are more than zero)

This is a partial student solution to the problem and is a work in progress.  Right now, when the program is run, it loops infinitely asking for the 'width'.  The current solution is inefficient as the student has not yet got to the part of the learning program where functions are introduced.

Can you get this code to work?  We are not worrying about removing repeated code at this stage.
