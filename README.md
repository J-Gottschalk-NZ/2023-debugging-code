# 2023-debugging-code
All the code in this folder needs to be debugged.

The first 21 problems are taken from [codewof.co.nz](https://codewof.co.nz/) (Debugging questions), with a few, very minor changes.  If you have an account on codewof, it is recommended that you use that resource rather than this code.

This code forms part of a demo / workshop for the Google Educators Conference (formerly CS4HS) held in Auckland in November 2023.
