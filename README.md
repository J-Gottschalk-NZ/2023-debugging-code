# 2023-debugging-code
All the code in this folder needs to be debugged.

The first 21 problems are taken from [codewof.co.nz](https://codewof.co.nz/) (Debugging questions), with a few, very minor changes.  If you have an account on codewof, it is recommended that you use that resource rather than this code.

The code in the 'Student' folder has been kindly donated by my students and shows actual mistakes that students might make.  Please see the 'readme' files associated with the various code examples as they give valuable information that you need to successfully debug / improve the student code.

This code forms part of a demo / workshop for the Google Educators Conference (formerly CS4HS) held in Auckland in November 2023.
